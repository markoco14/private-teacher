      "answer": "Yes, students can book single classes or multiple classes in advance. For a single class, students will choose the day with the teacher and pay in advance. For multiple classes, students will choose which days they can attend class for a lesson package. Each week, students can confirm their days with their teacher. With multiple classes, students can reschedule on 24-hour notice, because we understand that things happen in life."
