---Q_BOOK_ADVANCE---
Can I book classes in advance?

---A_BOOK_ADVANCE---
Yes, students can book single classes or multiple classes in advance. For a single class, students will choose the day with the teacher and pay in advance. For multiple classes, students will choose which days they can attend class for a lesson package. Each week, students can confirm their days with their teacher. With multiple classes, students can reschedule on 24-hour notice, because we understand that things happen in life.

---Q_REFUNDS---
Do you offer refunds or rescheduling

---A_REFUNDS---
I do offer rescheduling, but it depends on what booking the students make. If students buy multiple classes in advance, we can reschedule on 24-hour notice. However, students will need to use their classes within a specified timeframe. Refunds can be available under certain circumstances on agreement with the teacher.

---Q_PAYMENTS---
How can I pay for classes?

---A_PAYMENTS---
After contacting the teacher and agreeing upon the class and time, you can pay by Line Pay or bank transfer.
